Notice:  I'm moving to a new job.  New email is lm@who.net.

Who am I?
</H1>
<p>
I'm an engineer for Silicon Graphics, working in the networking group.
I spend most of my time waving my hands and convincing other people they 
want to work on stuff that I think is important.  The name server is
an example, I got 
<A HREF="/jes_engr/">John Schimmel</a> to work on that.
I'm constantly trying
to figure out how to make things go fast, which is why I wrote the
<A HREF="lmbench/lmbench.html">lmbench</a> benchmark suite.  Lmbench 
measures the basic building blocks of a computer system.
Occasionally, I have to
do real work, like the BDS stuff mentioned below.  
</p>
<p>
I live in San Francisco and divide my time there between my girlfriend,
woodworking, playing pool, and riding motorcycles.

Me and <A HREF="pictures/me+jacob.jpg">my nephew</A>
Jacob at Ocean Beach in
San Francisco. He was about 2 years old and still hadn't hit the terrible
twos, I think his Mom must have done a good job.  
Here he is with <a href="pictures/annelies+jacob.jpg">his Mom</a> about
7 months pregnant.  The next one turned out to be a boy 
<a href="pictures/annelies+zeke.jpg">named Zeke</a>.

doing some stupid <A HREF="pictures/skating.jpg">rollerblading</A> tricks.
<LI>My <A HREF="pictures/sail.jpg">favorite</A> picture of me.

<H2>My cats</H2>
<UL>
<LI>I like cats and I have had two over the last 18 years (whew) or so.
Here's <A HREF="pictures/zoey.jpg">Zoey</A> after she's had a few.
Looks possessed, doesn't she?  Here's a
<A HREF="pictures/zoey2.jpg">better</a> picture of her.  Until she died around
Christmas of 1994, she had outlasted all of my girlfriends - I had her
for almost 14 years.  I still miss her and sometimes look for her when
I go into the kitchen - it's weird to think she's gone.
I eventually decided not to mope over her forever and went and 
found <A HREF="pictures/mama+linux.jpg">Mama cat</A>
at the pound.  That's Linux running on the PC next to her, she fixes a lot
of mouse driver bugs.  
Here's another picture of <A HREF="pictures/cat.jpg">Mama cat on the workbench
</a>.  And one <A HREF="pictures/mama1.jpg">more</a> of here in my van - she
likes to travel, no kidding.  One last <A HREF="pictures/mama2.jpg">shot</a>
of her.
<LI>November '96:  Mama cat is missing.  
We're still looking for her, but it has been two weeks and
it isn't looking very hopeful.
<LI>January '97:  Mama cat is still missing.  I go to the pound about
once a week with no luck.  It sucks.

<H2>Fishing</H2>
<UL>
<LI>I like to fly fish (yeah, I tie my own, ooh, wow) and I took
a trip with my friend John Weitz.  John is a hot shot 
photographer and here he is at <A HREF="pictures/jonw-pic.jpg">work</a>.
Here's John catching a <A
HREF="pictures/john-fishing.jpg">trout</A> in the Trinity Alps.  This is
<A HREF="pictures/fishing.jpg">me fishing</A> in the upper Sacramento River.
John was talking some shots of a cool old 
<A HREF="pictures/house.jpg">shed</a>,
so I took one too.  Here's a shot that John took of
<A HREF="pictures/redneck.jpg">me sitting in the doorway</a> of that shed
(warning: it's ~60Kb).
<LI>This is the ultimate in fishing tall tails, except I have pictures
to prove it happened.  I was fishing in Canada and thought I had hooked
some weeds.  I was reeling it in when all at once it took off.  Funny sort
of fish, it felt weird.  When I get closer, I saw that I had two fish -
a little one that had hit the lure, and a big
<A HREF="pictures/pike1.jpg">Northern Pike</A> that had hit the little pike.
I thought for sure he would let go when he saw me, but I guess he was
hungry, because I
<A HREF="pictures/pike2.jpg">picked him up</A>.  Pretty wild, huh?

<H2>Wilderness</H2>

<LI>I like to <A HREF="pictures/backpacking.jpg">backpack</a>
a lot and I have some friends that go with me.  Here's

<LI>Me <A HREF="pictures/me-skiing.jpg">cross country skiing</A> in the Sierra
back country.  It was a weekend trip to Ostrander Hut/Lake (cool place).
I think that is Yosemite Valley in the background, doesn't that look like
half dome to you?  Here's the same 
<A HREF="pictures/skiing.jpg">view</a>
about 5 years earlier with my friends 
John G., Bernd N., and Andy A.
<LI>My Dad's <A HREF="pictures/canoe+cover.jpg">Mad River canoe with a

kept us dry).  We go canoeing in Canada quite a bit.

<H2>Woodworking</H2>
<UL>
<LI>I am not just a computer nerd, I'm also a woodworking nerd, and I'm 
especially nerdy about <A HREF="pictures/planes.jpg">hand planes.</a>  Many
of those are a hundred years old, some are more than that ("they don't
make 'em like they used to" definitely applies to tools).
Here's my first effort at a real woodworking project, what else, a
<A HREF="pictures/toolbox3.jpg">toolbox</a>.  Here's a view with the
<A HREF="pictures/toolbox2.jpg">drawers open.</a>  The little box on top is a
jewelry box (or whatever) I made for an old girlfriend.
I live in San Francisco, in
a flat, so my workshop is out on my <A HREF="pictures/jointer.jpg">back deck</a>.
That's a small jointer in the foreground and a table saw clamped to the
rails in the background.  It's a bit cramped, but it has a nice
<A HREF="pictures/jointer2.jpg">view.</a>
I finally decided to build a <A HREF="pictures/workbench.jpg">workbench.</a>
Here's the <A HREF="pictures/benchtop.jpg">benchtop</a> in the process of being
hand planed flat (lotso shavings, huh?).
<LI>
I do stuff on commission sometimes, this is my last girlfriend with a
<A HREF="pictures/bookshelf.jpg">bookshelf</a> I built for a friend at
work.  It was pretty simple since it was a first try, but he liked it.
Here's another picture of the <A HREF="pictures/bookshelf2.jpg">bookshelf</a>.
<LI>Here I am proudly showing off a little 
<A HREF="pictures/tv-cabinet+me2.jpg">TV cabinet</a> made out of pine with some
really interesting grain.  That's the heartwood of the pine.
Here's a <A HREF="pictures/tv-cabinet.jpg">closeup</a> picture of
the cabinet.

<LI>
Because space is tight in San Francisco, I think my next project will be
a tall, thin
<A HREF="pictures/chest.gif">
chest of drawers</a>
sort of like a lingerie chest, only sized for guy's clothes.  It's about 
six feet tall by 18 inches square, which I think is about right.  This was
drawn in James Clark's implementation of pic, in the groff tool suite.
Perverse, I know.

Here is a document on <a href="papers/flattening.html">flattening</a>
hand planes, something that is frequently required for good performance.

<LI>A <A href="excited.html">song</a> composed in my honor.  No kidding.
It's pretty cute but you might need to know a little about Sun's internal
politics to completely get it.
<p>
<LI>A 
<A HREF="javaletter.html">
letter</a>
that Sun's lawyers recently sent.  It's amazing how frigging

<li>Here are a bunch of
<A HREF="quote.html">quotes</a>
that I either liked or were attributed to me.  A lot of these are pretty
nerdy engineer inside jokes, you've been warned.
